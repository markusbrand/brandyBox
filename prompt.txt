create a desktop application running on windows, linux und mac. It should be possible to install this application without admin permissions on the client.
Provide an installer for all 3 operating systems (linux, windows and mac).

From the features and functionality it should be similar to dropbox.com desktop application. The name of the application should be 'Brandy Box'. Also automatically create logos for this application.

I want to use that app to access my raspberry pi storage from everywhere and synchronize the content of a local folder to this remote raspberry pi folder. Similar to dropbox it should synch a local folder to my raspberry pi HDD storage. the HDD storage on raspberry pi is mounted to /mnt/shared_storage and for the data synchronization in this app I would like to use this folder: /mnt/shared_storage/brandyBox

To ensure access to the raspberry pi we use a cloudflare tunnel, which I map to the subdomain: brandybox.brandstaetter.rocks
The cloudflare service is already running on a docker container on the raspberry pi.
If the client PC is connected to the local network with name 'brandstaetter'. It should automatically switch from the cloudflare tunnel to the direct host address of the raspberry pi which is 192.168.0.150.

it should show a logo in the notification bar and start automatically on system boot. Also this logo should indicate whether the local folder has been synched successfully, is in synchronization state (synching), or failed to synchronize.

If you open the application settings it offers the user to choose a local folder which is used for synching.
